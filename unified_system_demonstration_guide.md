## 🛠️ **Developer Guide: Adding New Business Types**

**Time Required: 15 minutes for complete vertical addition**

### **Step 1: Extend Unified Config**
```typescript
// File: src/configs/inventory/unifiedConfigs.ts
export const unifiedConfigs = {
  // ...existing verticals

  salon: {
    businessType: "salon",
    ui: {
      fields: ["Service Type", "Stylist Assigned", "Appointment ID", "Duration", "Product Usage Notes"],
      theme: "bg-pink-50 text-pink-800 border-l-4 border-pink-500",
      defaultCategories: ["Hair Care", "Skin Care", "Nail Services", "Beauty Products"]
    },
    workflows: [
      "appointment_checkin",
      "product_usage_deduction",
      "loyalty_points_allocation"
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Step 2: Add Workflow Handlers**
```typescript
// File: src/middleware/inventoryWorkflow.ts
const workflowHandlers = {
  // ...existing handlers

  appointment_checkin: (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("🎀 Salon: Appointment check-in logged");
    next();
  },
  product_usage_deduction: (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("✂️ Salon: Deduct beauty products used in service");
    next();
  },
  loyalty_points_allocation: (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("💕 Salon: Allocate loyalty points for VIP treatment");
    next();
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Database Extensions (Optional)**
```prisma
// File: prisma/schema.prisma
model Appointment {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  customerId  String
  stylist     String
  serviceType String
  date        DateTime
  duration    Int
  notes       String?
}
```

### **Step 4: Testing**
Set user `businessType: "salon"` → Full salon experience automatically active!
